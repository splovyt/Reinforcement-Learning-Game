# Reinforcement-Learning-Game

A reinforcement learning environment created to allow development of reinforcement learning algorithms, including basic solutions.

## The Challenge

Use my Bomberman-inspired game environment (Py3) to explore and train reinforcement learning algorithms (MCTS, DQN, Genetic Algorithms, and more) to develop an unbeatable AI agent.

Instructions on how to install this environment can be found below.

## State of my solutions

**A. Deep Q Network (DQN)**

Basic implementation is complete.


**B. Genetic Algorithms (GA) - In Progress**

Currently randomly plays games to collect data for future selection.


**C. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - In Progress**

Highest potential for a good solutions (ref. AlphaGo and Chess), but still needs to be added. 


## Instructions on how to install the environment

## How to play
1. Install the ```requirements.txt``` or ```dev-requirements.txt``` file.

2. Navigate to the ```play.py``` file.

3. (OPTIONAL) Connect Player 2 to a smart agent.

4. Run the ```play.py``` file.

The standard controls in the play.py file are:
```
W (UP)
S (DOWN)
A (LEFT)
D (RIGHT)
SPACE (BOMB)
```

**Standard example: Player vs. Random Bot**
