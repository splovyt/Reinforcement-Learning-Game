# Reinforcement-Learning-Game

A reinforcement learning environment created to allow development of reinforcement learning algorithms, including basic solutions.
&nbsp;
## State of the solutions

**Deep Q Network (DQN)**

Basic implementation is complete.

&nbsp;
**Genetic Algorithms (GA)**

Currently randomly plays games to collect data for future selection.

&nbsp;
**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**

Highest potential for a good solutions (ref. AlphaGo and Chess), but still needs to be added.
