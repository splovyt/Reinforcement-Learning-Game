# Reinforcement-Learning-Game

A reinforcement learning environment created to allow development of reinforcement learning algorithms, including basic solutions.


## State of the solutions

**A. Deep Q Network (DQN) - In Progress**

Basic implementation is complete.


**B. Genetic Algorithms (GA) - In Progress**

Currently randomly plays games to collect data for future selection.


**C. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - In Progress**

Highest potential for a good solutions (ref. AlphaGo and Chess), but still needs to be added.
